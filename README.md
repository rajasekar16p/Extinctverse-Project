# Extinctverse-Project
Extinctverse is a Windows virtual reality experience that allows people to see some of the extinct species(Dinosaurs, mammoth, quagga..etc.,.) in their real life look and provide some details about them and how they went extinct. It offers a learning experience about the extinct species and awareness to save the living species for the future generations.
